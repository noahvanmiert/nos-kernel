# NOS-KERNEL
---

Hello everyone, I'm Noah Van Miert, I live in Belgium and I'm 14 years old.
I'm really interested in operating systems and kernels. So I tought maybe I
should try to make one myself. This is ofcourse very difficult
so I've no idea were this will end.

I think it would be amazing if I could build this together with other people. So if you
see this and want to help, don't hesitate and contact me (noahvanmiert@gmail.com).

I'm planning to make the kernel in C, cause I like it and I think it's 
the best for low level system programming. We will use nasm as the assembler.
