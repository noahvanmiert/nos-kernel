# NOS-KERNEL
---

Hello everyone, I'm Noah Van Miert, I live in Belgium and I'm 14 years old.
I'm really interested in operating systems and kernels. So I tought maybe I
should try to make one myself. This is ofcourse very difficult
so I've no idea were this will end.

I'm planning to make the kernel in C, cause I like it and I think it's 
the best for low level system programming. I will use nasm as the assembler.

# Goals

- File systems
	- FAT (File Allocation Table)
	- exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table)

- Architectures
	- x86
	- x64
	- arm

- Booting
	- Boot the system.
	- Initialize hardware components (CPU, memory, ...)

- System Services
	- Memory management
	- Process management
	- Input/Ouput operations

- Programs
	- Load and run programs.

- UI
	- CLI (Command Line Interface).
	- Maybe a simple GUI in the future.

- Scheduler
	- Simple scheduler to manage the execution of processes.

- Drivers
	- Basic device drivers for storage devices and network interfaces.

# Additional Goals

+ Support for multiple processors and/or multi-core CPUs.
+ Virtual memory support, including demand paging and page swapping.
+ Support for advanced I/O, such as asynchronous I/O and direct memory acces (DMA).
+ Networking support, including TCP/IP and other networking protocols.
+ Support for advanced security features, such as encryption and access control.
+ Support for real-time applications, including real-time scheduling and real-time I/O.
+ Support for advanced power management features, such as CPU frequency scaling and device power management.
