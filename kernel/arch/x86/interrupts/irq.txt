Here's a high-level overview of how hardware interrupts work:

A hardware device or component generates an interrupt request (IRQ) signal. This signal is typically sent
to a hardware interrupt controller, such as a Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC), which routes 
the request to the appropriate interrupt handler in the kernel.

The kernel's interrupt handler is called to handle the interrupt. 
The handler determines the source of the interrupt and takes any 
necessary actions, such as servicing the device or handling a hardware 
exception.

While the interrupt handler is running, the kernel saves 
the current state of the interrupted process and disables further 
interrupts to prevent multiple interrupts from occurring simultaneously.

After the interrupt handler has completed its tasks,
the kernel restores the state of the interrupted process and re-enables interrupts.

Control is returned to the interrupted process, which resumes execution.

To write a driver for a PIC, you will need to:

1) Identify the specific PIC that you are using and familiarize yourself with its documentation and programming interface.
2) Determine what functions you want your driver to perform, such as initializing the PIC, setting up interrupt handlers, and masking/unmasking interrupts.
3) Implement these functions in your driver code, taking into account any specific details or considerations for the particular PIC you are using.
4) Test your driver to ensure that it is working correctly and performing the desired functions.
